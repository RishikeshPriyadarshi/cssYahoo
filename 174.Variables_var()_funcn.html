To make CSS variables 
we have to use Sudo Class-->>> root

*** root is Global it makes Global Variable..

i.e. //sudo class root -- To make sudo class we will take hyphen(--) 2 times 
with the variable name..
ex: --main-color:red;

:root{

}

whatever varibales we make inside root we can use througout the class anywhere..


for example:

:root{
    --main-color : red; 
}

   >>here the name of VARIABLE is main-color and inside that its value is red 
      and now we can use this color anywhere in the class as many times as we want

    > suppose we have used the red color 10 times in class and if we change once 
     the color in the root class , it will automatically get changed everywhere



     ******

     /*
        Inside sudo-class root we can variables as many we want 100,50 whtaever we want
        and then We can CALL it as many times as we want
     */

     How To Use:

     :root{
        --main-color:red; //variable Defining or Definition
     }

     .classA{
        color:var(--main-color); //Here we r calling the funcn var

     }

     .classB{
        color:var(--main-color); //Calling Variable
     }

     .classC{
        background-color: var(--main-color); //Calling Variable
     }




NOTE:When we make the variables under "root", it becomes Global...
     Global means we can use that Variable anywhere in the Website... 



**************** *******************

When we want to use our variable in the limited area then we give the "Scope:LOCAL"

Example:
.classA{
    --main-color:red; // when we make the "Variable" inside the class then 
                      //Scope is Local means it will work only in classA...
    color: var(--main-color);
}

.classA a{
    background-color:var(--main-color);
}


Note: "When we make the "VARIABLE" inside the class then scope is LOCAL"..
