>>GRADIENT property is used when we want to use more than one color in the BACKGROUND

>>Types of GRADIENT
(i)-Linear Gradient-->It goes from one side to other
    like Top to Bottom,Left to Right,Right to Left,Bottom to Top

    means  it goes from left to Right
    i.e Top Left Right Right Bottom respectively will be in dark shade.


(ii)-Radial Gradient-->>In this we will start(shade) from any point or the center
    and it will may form center or ecclipse


(iii)-Repeating Linear Gradient-->


(iv)-Repeating Radial Gradient


>>>When direction is not mentioned it(color) will go from top to Bottom


>>In Radial-Gradient we can define the shape too like circle,ellipse etc

>>In Radial-Gradient we can diffrent sizes also like,
farthest side,closest side,  farthest corner,closest corner...


in closest-side it will make circle..

in farthest side it will make ellipse..

>>IN Radial-Gradient color will start from center and it will go around it..

>>NOTE::Repeating works only when we define the the color with percentage...
